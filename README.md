#  Project Title:

## Project Description:

## Data:
We still didn't get our dataset, so we will update it in a few days.

# CRISP-DM Process:

Cross-industry standard process for data mining, known as CRISP-DM, is an open standard process model that describes common approaches used by data mining experts. It is the most widely-used analytics model.

This model is an idealised sequence of events. In practice many of the tasks can be performed in a different order and it will often be necessary to backtrack to previous tasks and repeat certain actions. The model does not try to capture all possible routes through the data mining process.
CRISP-DM breaks the process of data mining into six major phases:

* Business Understanding
* Data Understanding
* Data Preparation
* Modeling
* Evaluation
* Deployment

 ## Business Understanding

The first thing we must do in any project is to find out exactly what we are trying to accomplish. We must state objectives and requirements. We must translate these goals and restrictions into the formulation of a data mining problem definition. We must start with a clear understanding of

* A problem that you want to address/ Objectives

* The business goals

* Constraints

 Finally, we prepare a preliminary strategy for achieving these objectives.
